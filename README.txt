This is a hack of Dragon Ball Z: Legacy of Goku, for the Game Boy Advance. Its
purpose is to balance the game's difficulty, fix bugs and also improve its flow.

Changes:
  * Enemies only do a fraction of the damage they normally would,
    depending on how strong they are.
  * Flight now regenerates when you're not flying.
  * Stats changed on all levels, for a more gradual increase in strength.
  * Attacks no longer have a chance of causing no damage.
  * Fixed bug where attacks would heal, potentially overflowing the target's
    health and instantly killing them (targets including Goku himself!)
  * Boosted health of Raditz, Vegeta and Ginyu.
  * Changed bankrobber's health from 7000 to 800.
  * The last few levels are much easier to acquire.

Changelog:
  Version 1.1:
    * Actually boost Raditz's health, oops.
